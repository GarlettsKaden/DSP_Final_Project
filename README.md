Some general information regarding purposes and potential.
Each category will serve as a type for each business, which I may personally dissect into smaller sub-categories.

b. The dataset should be a very high quality as it managed by the hackettown business improvment district. Meaning that they are hired by hackettstown, themselves to collect information about hackettstowns businesses.

d. The HackettstownBId could be a potential client as they should be the most curious about data-analysis regarding hackettstown businesses. Private institutions looking to formulate business potential in hackettstown.

e. This idea should be very fruitful, with capabilities of expanding on outside of class experience and related work.
